# ChalkBoard

A college web application which allows schools to build the digital learning environment. ChalkBoard simplifies teaching by the instructors and learning by the students learning, thereby reducing the stress and enhancing education.

ChalkBoard allows students to access their courses. Students can view assignments and announcements, participate in discussions through live chats, view grades and course materials.
While Instructors can add and view announcements, assignments and downloadable course materials to a class; Chat with students in a class, chnage and view students grades, add and delete students from a class etc 

The ChalkBoard app only works for students and instructors who are already registered. Thereby preventing students and instructors from registering themselves in a school's database. 
So the following user ID's and passwords can be used to login:
